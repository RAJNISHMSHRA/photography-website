<h3>Get in Touch
Don’t forget to include the link to your ‘Contact Me’ page to make it clear how to get in touch with you. Direct readers to your Facebook and/or Twitter profiles to show that you’re social, and let them follow your updates. You can also ask people to subscribe to your blog updates or some lists. That’s how a strong target audience can be built.

Clients List and Testimonials
If you have some prominent clients on your list, don’t hesitate to show it off to the viewers. Moreover, you can include a few testimonials or other reassurances to make people know that they’re at the right place and to let them know what your real clients think of your work. Testimonials may be written by some notable people or just ordinary readers; it does not matter. The proof is the proof.

I hope this list of small tips would help you to build cool ‘About Me’ page. Here are creative examples of well-done ‘About Me’ pages of photographers, handpicked from all over the web. Scroll down and enjoy!
