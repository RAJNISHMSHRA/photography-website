		<p>Last year the contest attracted more than 13,600 participants.  The competition was organized in 26 countries in the same time, while the additional contest category ‘Biosphere reserves’ was open to participants from all 120 countries that are members of the UNESCO’s world network of biosphere reserves. The top 15 photos came from Serbia, Bulgaria, Nepal, Estonia, Ukraine, Spain, Austria, Brazil, Germany, and Thailand.<br>

And again Wiki Loves Earth is set to start crowdsourcing gorgeous landscapes in May. Anyone can take part in the competition; however, registration on Wikimedia Commons is required. To enter the contest, find an item or place you are familiar with from the competition list, submit a picture you have taken (past or present), and upload it to Wikimedia Commons beginning May 1 through May 31, 2016.<br>

The full report of the last year’s international jury, explaining its work, selection process and bringing the results together with comments of the jury, is available here.<br>

We invite everyone to make this year’s contest a great and valuable contribution to free knowledge!<br>
